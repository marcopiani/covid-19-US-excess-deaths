# covid-19-US-excess-deaths
Data and analysis of US excess deaths for the sake of understanding the dynamics and the impact of COVID-19 in the USA

CDC datafiles are stored in the /data folder. Please add datafiles as needed using the format

$standard-CDC-filename_up_to_$date-last-week-covered

For example:

I have saved

"Excess_Deaths_Associated_with_COVID-19.csv"

released with data up to September 12, 2020, with name

"Excess_Deaths_Associated_with_COVID-19_up_to_20200912.csv"

SOURCES:

The initial choice of source is the CDC page about excess deaths as related to COVID-19: https://cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm

The files "Excess_Deaths_Associated_with_COVID-19.csv" can be obtained at the link 
https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/xkkf-xrst/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD&bom=true&format=true%20target=

*Given that these data are about deaths by date of death and that figures about these are updated for dates in the past as more certificates make their way to CDC, it is imporant to keep older versions of the files readily available for comparison.
